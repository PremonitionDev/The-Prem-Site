Hello there! My name is Prxem but you can just call me Prem for short! I am an aspiring software
developer and founder of False Reality, an Indie Development team aiming to bring innovative and
new experiences to the masses!

This is just my blog though, I'll just be using this as what you could essentially call a testbench
for how Jekyll, the backend of this site, works and just general updates on what I'm upto and what
I'm currently working on.

Thank you!
