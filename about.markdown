Hello there! My name is Prxem but you can just call me Prem for short! I am an aspiring software
developer and founder of False Reality, an Indie Development team aiming to bring innovative and
new experiences to the masses!

I am always looking to learn new skills, which is why I put this site together in order to broaden
what I am capable of as the space of PCs, programming and things assosiated with that are ever-changing!
On this site you can learn more about what I'm upto at any given time, what projects I'm working on and
other assosrted things.

I guess you could just call this page a testbench then? I'll see what happens, but having this is better
than not having one at all I guess.

Thank you for reading!
