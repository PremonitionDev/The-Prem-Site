Hello! This is just a small post to explain what I'm going to be using this for going forward.

## General Updates

I like to be as transparent as possible with people, and this blog helps with that.
As and when I'm working on things, I'll post about it here as well as my twitter,
this way people are always in the know on what I'm doing, whether that be the short-hand
version on twitter or a more in-depth explaination here on this.

## Testbench

I'm also going to be using this as a general testbench to see what I can do for when I eventually
put together a similarly structured site for False Reality to replace the current half-baked
neocities solution that we don't talk about.

## Other Assorted Stuff

I'm probably also going to be using this as just a place to just dump my thoughts every now and
again, be it about a game design challenge I want to discuss, or I might just want to talk about
a game that I've been playing recently. Whatever works I guess!

Anyway, thank you for reading and I hope to have some more stuff here in the future!
