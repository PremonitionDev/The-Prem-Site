# MEANINGLESS

MEANINGLESS is a currently in-development horror game being develped in the style of 
a late 90s PS1/Early PC Release. It focuses less on upfront horror tropes and leans more into
atmospheric horror to keep players questioning everything. This project is currently not available
for the public, but will be in the future.
